}
```

### 5. RAG Retrieval From Existing Chroma DB Vector Store Generated Previously

This api is used to retrieve data from previously created Chroma DB vector store. It takes in the query, vector_store_name, search_type and search_kwargs in the request body and fetches the document based on the search_type and search_kwarrgs specified .The api supports different retrieval methods like Similarity Search,  Max Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Similarity Score Threshold.

**HTTP Method Type** : POST

**Request Body Fields**

- query
- vector_store_name
- search_type
- search_kwargs

**Endpoint**

```
http://localhost:8000/rag/retrieveRagDataFromVectorStore
```

**Search Types**
1. Similarity Search: This method retrieves documents based on vector similarity. It finds the most similar documents to the query vector based on cosine similarity. Use this when you want to retrieve the top k most similar documents.

**Similarity Search Example Curl and Response**
<br/>
Curl:

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/rag/retrieveRagDataFromVectorStore' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "query":"Who is Odysseus wife?",
    "vector_store_name":"chroma_db",
    "search_type":"similarity",
    "search_kwargs":{"k": 3}
}'
```
Response:
```json

The fame, therefore, of her virtue\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be\nwelcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far\notherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed\nher lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has\nbrought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.‚Äù",

Still, people cannot do\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on\nearth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline\nupon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from\nthe day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.‚Äù\n\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her\nmaidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva\nshed sweet sleep over her eyelids.\n\n\nBOOK XX",

He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat\ndown opposite his wife on the seat he had left. ‚ÄúMy dear,‚Äù said he,\n‚Äúheaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever\nyet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when\nhe had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having\ngone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will\nsleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.‚Äù",
            "type": "Document"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Max Marginal Relevance (MMR): This method balances between selecting documents that are relevant to the query and diverse among themselves. 'fetch_k' specifies the number of documents to initially fetch based on similarity. 'lambda_mult' controls the diversity of the results: 1 for minimum diversity, 0 for maximum. Use this when you want to avoid redundancy and retrieve diverse yet relevant documents.
Note: Relevance measures how closely documents match the query. Diversity ensures that the retrieved documents are not too similar to each other, providing a broader range of information.

3. Similarity Score Threshold: This method retrieves documents that exceed a certain similarity score threshold. 'score_threshold' sets the minimum similarity score a document must have to be considered relevant. Use this when you want to ensure that only highly relevant documents are retrieved, filtering out less relevant ones.
